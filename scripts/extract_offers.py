# Structures each offer's free text with an LLM. Run locally only.
# In this project the LLM step was done with Claude instead of Ollama (allowed by the
# instructor), with exactly this prompt. Every output was then reviewed by hand
# (critique pass, CM5): 2 invented "Pandas" skills removed, 1 absurd compensation
# figure ("0,10 EUR par mois") rejected -- see README section 5.
# Output (data/offers/structured_offers.json) is gitignored: scraped content stays local.

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Extract ONLY these things from this job/internship description text
(it may be in French or English).
Return ONLY valid JSON with keys:
- required_skills: array of concrete named tools/technologies/hard skills mentioned (e.g. "Python", "Power BI") -- do not include generic soft skills or the job title
- responsibilities: array of the actual tasks/missions described
- experience_required: a short string quoting the explicit experience requirement stated in the text (e.g. "2 years", "no experience required", "Bac+5", "enrolled in a Master's program"), or null if the text does not explicitly state one. Do NOT infer this from the job title, from words like "Senior"/"Lead" in the title, or from general seniority tone -- only from an actual requirement sentence in the text.
- compensation_mentioned: a short verbatim quote of any salary/compensation/gratification FIGURE explicitly stated in the text (e.g. "75-90k EUR package", "600 euros/mois"), or null if no concrete number is stated anywhere in the text. Read the ENTIRE text, including the end, before concluding there is none.

Do not extract title, company, or location -- those come from elsewhere and are not in this text.
No explanation, just the JSON object.
